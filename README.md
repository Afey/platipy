Platipy: making documentation more useful
=======

Platipy is a chrome extension that works with all documentation hosted by Read the Docs.  

Sifting through documentation can often be a painful process and updating documentation is sometimes very slow.  Platipy enables developers to insert comments and example code directly into a portion of the documentation that could use clarification.  Users can also favorite sections of documenation and pose questions to other users.  These comments and questions can then be seen by all future developers who come to a piece of documentation looking for answers or implementation assistance.

Platipy is written in Python, Flask, Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS, and uses Github's Oauth API for user authentication.  The Pygments python library is used for syntax highlighting, and Bootstrap is used for front-end framework.  The backend uses a Postgres database hosted by Heroku.
