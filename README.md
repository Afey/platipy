Platipy: making documentation more useful
=======

Platipy is a chrome extension that enables developers to annotate and clarify confusing documentation.

Sifting through documentation can often be a painful process and updating documentation is sometimes very slow. Platipy works with all documentation hosted by Read the Docs and enables developers to insert comments and example code directly into a portion of the documentation that could use clarification.  Users can favorite sections of documentation and pose questions to other users. These comments and questions can then be seen by all future developers who come to a piece of documentation looking for answers or implementation assistance.
Platipy is written in Python, Flask, Javascript, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, HTML and CSS, and uses Github's OAuth API for user authentication. The Pygments python library is used for syntax highlighting. The backend is powered by a Postgres database hosted on Heroku.
